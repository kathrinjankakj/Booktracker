# Booktracker



## About

This app is a booktracker to conveniently track the books you already read, you want to read or are currently reading.

Once you read a book you can also rate the book on a scala form 1 to 5 stars and pick your favorite in terms of content.

If you started a book you can add when you started it and continuously update the page you're currently on.

You can also search for specific titles or authors or filter the page by categories.

If the book you're looking for doesn't exist yet you can add it manually by adding the necessary information like title, author, language, a cover the number of pages and more.

## Installation
Start the project by opening it in an IDE (eg. PyCharm) and type python manage.py runserver in the terminal.
